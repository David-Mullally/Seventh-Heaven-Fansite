      <p class="intro">Welcome to Seventh Heaven. A bar located in the Sector 7 slum.</p>
      <p>A favourite afterwork hangout for laborers. Tifa's cocktails and cooking are BIG hits among the locals. After hours ,though,
        the place functions as a hideout for the anti-Shinra group Avalanche... Oh crap! I shouldn't have said that it functions as a hideout...
        Oh crap! I shouldn't have said that the group is anti-Shinra... Oh crap! I definitely shouldn't have said the groups name is Avalanche... Ahh! Its too hot today.
